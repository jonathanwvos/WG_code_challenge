# WG_code_challenge
## Setup
For this challenge I used the Python Anaconda and pip.

## Question 1
This is a coding task that involves finding the missing integer in a shuffled set of contiguous integers. The input contains a flat file that presents the series in the following format: 
There are multiple problems within a file. Individual problems are delimited with a header. The header is a greater than character $>$ followed by an integer $N$ as a header line. An example header is: $>10$. The value $N$ indicates the size of the set. Following this is a series of $N - 1$ integers which can span multiple lines.


## Question 2 
This involves finding a 2x copy number gain. The problem folder attached contains a mock reference genome, a .bed file containing mock gene annotations, a set of baseline reads (which don't contain the copy number gain), a set of reads where one of the annotations has a 2x copy gain and thus a significant change to the depth of coverage. This task involves finding which annotation contains that gain. 
The mock genome was generated by a random nucleotide sequence concatenation. Both baseline reads were generated via wgsim and the reads in the query set (following the naming paradigm: reads_R*.fastq.gz) were artificially amplified only in one of the bed intervals. For this question we ask that you provide us with the name of the annotation where this copy gain occurred and the methodology you used to find it. You can assume the reads will not contain any PCR or optical duplications. These files were generated on a Mac so let me know if there is an issue with carriage returns or line endings and Iâ€™ll be happy to reformat files as needed.
Feel free to analyse the data further and present any stats or interesting metrics you discover.
